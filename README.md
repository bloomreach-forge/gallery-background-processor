# Gallery Background Processor Plugin

Have image variants created in a background process.

The Gallery Background Processor plugin will move the creation process of image variants from inside the upload request 
to a background process. This can be useful when an image set has many configured variants.

The plugin provides an alternative gallery processor class that only creates the original and thumbnail variants 
directly and posts an event to a repository module, that will create the other variants in the background.   

# Documentation

Documentation is available at [bloomreach-forge.github.io/gallery-background-processor/](https://bloomreach-forge.github.io/gallery-background-processor/)

The online documentation is generated by this command from the master branch:

 > mvn -Pgithub.pages clean site:site
 
The output is in the ```/docs``` directory (only on master); push it and GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically. 

For rendering documentation on non-master branches, use the normal site command so the output will be in the 
```/target``` and therefore ignored by Git.
