## Installation
These instructions assume a Hippo CMS project based on the Hippo website archetype, i.e. a Maven multi-module project 
with parent pom `org.onehippo.cms7:hippo-cms7-release` and consisting of at least three sub-modules: cms, site and repository data.

### Forge Repository
In the main pom.xml of the project, in the repositories section, add this repository if it is not configured there yet. 

```
<repository>
  <id>hippo-forge</id>
  <name>Hippo Forge maven 2 repository.</name>
  <url>https://maven.onehippo.com/maven2-forge/</url>
  <snapshots>
    <enabled>false</enabled>
  </snapshots>
  <releases>
    <updatePolicy>never</updatePolicy>
  </releases>
  <layout>default</layout>
</repository>
```

### Dependency Management 
Add this property to the properties section of the root pom.xml:

    <hippo.forge.gallery-background.version>version.number</hippo.forge.gallery-background.version>

Select the correct version for your project. See the [release notes](release-notes.html) for more information on which 
version is applicable.

Add this dependency to the `<dependencyManagement>` section of the root pom.xml:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.onehippo.forge.gallery-background</groupId>
  <artifactId>hippo-gallery-background-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${hippo.forge.gallery-background.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
### Installation in the CMS application
Add the following dependency to `cms/pom.xml`.
 
``` 
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.onehippo.forge.gallery-background</groupId>
  <artifactId>hippo-gallery-background-plugin</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Rebuild your project and distribute. In case you start with an existing repository don't forget to add *-Drepo.bootstrap=true*
to your startup options.
