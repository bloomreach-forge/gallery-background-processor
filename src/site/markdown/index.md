## Gallery Background Processor Plugin

The Gallery Background Processor plugin will move the creation process of image variants from inside the upload request 
to a background process. This can be useful when an image set has many configured variants.

The plugin provides an alternative gallery processor class that only creates the original and thumbnail variants 
directly and posts an event to a repository module, that will create the other variants in the background.
